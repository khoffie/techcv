ABOUT ME

I am a passionate researcher and data scientist specializing in mathematical modeling and Bayesian methods to solve real-
world problems. Eager to learn and grow, I plan to ﬁnish my PhD thesis in February. I seek to transition from research to
industry to make a tangible impact on society.

• I implemented and extended the code for a mathematical model to analyze migration patterns between German districts. While the
  conceptual framework was developed collaboratively with § scientist, I managed data preparation, integrated the prototype into a
  ﬂexible pipeline, created visualizations for clear result communication and conceived the mathematical notation.
• The nonlinear Bayesian model, implemented in Julia with Turing.jl, overcomes key limitations of standard approaches, providing
  unbiased predictions of migration ﬂows and revealing latent preferences for urban and rural areas. The code is available here: § .

Internship Data Scientist                                                                                                           Earth GmbH, Europe

• I built an image classiﬁcation tool using Python and Keras to ﬁnd out the race of customer’s dogs. Insurance premium was chosen
  based on the predicted race. This tool is still in use.
• I built a dashbord using R and Shiny for management and employees to see how the company is doing.

• Thesis: Deep Learning for Image Manipulation Detection (In cooperation with Earth GmbH)
  I replicated a deep learning paper which applies the Faster R-CNN architecture to detect image manipulation. I successfully ran their
  model in python and tensorflow. This work included debugging their code, augmenting data, ﬁne-tuning a pretrained network and
  exploring the architecture of CNNs.

  rates to sensitive survey questions.

• Reproducibility matters, to have conﬁdence in one’s results and so that others can use and extent the model.
