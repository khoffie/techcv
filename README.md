# techcv - Resume for Software Engineers 👨🏻‍💻
An easily parsable, single-page, one-column CV template for LaTeX. For
tech job applications

This template is a fork of this
https://github.com/alexcalabrese/techResume template. The latex code
is somewhat simpler and I added an aboutme and a skills section.

- ATS friendly;
- Single page;
- One column.

## Import project to Overleaf
You can download the project in .zip format by clicking [here](https://github.com/khoffie/techcv/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Then on **Overleaf** click on "**New Project**", click on "**Upload Project**" and upload the downloaded zip.

## Is it really ATS friendly?
To check, install poppler-utils https://pypi.org/project/poppler-utils/ and use pdftotext resume.pdf resme.txt.
