{Earth} {R, Julia, Turing.jl, Parallelization, spatial data} {Sept
  2021 â€“ Dez 2024}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item I implemented and extended the code for a mathematical model
         to analyze migration patterns between German districts. While
         the conceptual framework was developed collaboratively with
         \faGithub{\href{https://github.com/superscientist}{scientist}},
         I managed data preparation, integrated the prototype into a
         flexible pipeline, created visualizations for clear result
         communication and conceived the mathematical notation.
   \item The nonlinear Bayesian model, implemented in \texttt{Julia}
         with \texttt{Turing.jl}, overcomes key limitations of
         standard approaches, providing unbiased predictions of
         migration flows and revealing latent preferences for urban
         and rural areas. The code is available here:
         \href{https://github.com/superscientist/earthmigration}{\faGithub}.

\cventry{\textbf{Internship Data Scientist}} {Earth GmbH}
{Europe} {R, python, keras, shiny} {April 2019 - March 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I built an image classification tool using \texttt{Python} and
        \texttt{Keras} to find out the race of customer's dogs.
        Insurance premium was chosen based on the predicted race. This
        tool is still in use.
  \item I built a dashbord using \texttt{R} and \texttt{Shiny} for
        management and employees to see how the company is doing.
\end{itemize}
